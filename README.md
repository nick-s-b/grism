# Grism - A Stock Market Observation Tool

Homepage: http://www.grism.org

Grism allows you to track your favorite stocks in one of 2 modes:

1. Watchlist - See the stock's current price as well as a watch start
price so you can track how the stock has done since you began watching
it.

2. Portfolio - See the stock's current price as well as the price at
which it was purchased, the number of shares involved and gain/loss
calculations.

Grism currently uses the services provided by Yahoo! Finance to
retrieve current stock price quotes.

Grism is written with the Ruby-GTK bindings (from [Ruby GNOME2](https://ruby-gnome2.osdn.jp/)).

The latest version is 0.9.0.
